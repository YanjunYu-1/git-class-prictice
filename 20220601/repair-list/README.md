//20200601项目详解

一、布局

1.建立文件夹 npx create-react-app repair-list

2.删除无用的文件和链接

3.将有用的代码copy到App.js中

（1）直接copy会有格式问题可以用快捷键修复
```java
Alt + shift + F
```
(2)在app.js中input标签需要闭合“/”

4.将css文件内容粘贴到App.css中

5.建立组件components，建最简单的Header和Footer放入

6.此时浏览器有错误，不需要修改，错误是因为rander造成的

7.在components中放入RepairList修复列表

8.再次细分Header，将Form提取出来，并正确显示

9.在此使用新的方法在app.js中使用Form.jsx

10.完成全部的代码布局

二、详细代码

2-1设定最小子集repair，针对要展示的信息，设定所需要的props，然后再repairList中设定props，进行信息的初始化

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
